# gif

## Overview

We should know that in order to achieve Gif in flutter, we can use Image, but we have no way to manipulate Gif, for example: change its speed, control it has been playing in a frame,
 in which frame range loop. These problems can be solved by this widget, it also help you contain gif cache, avoid load frame every time.

## Example

 Load a gif asynchronously and display a text placeholder during loading.<br>
 When the gif is loaded reset the controller and run the gif to the end.

 ```dart
GifController _controller = GifController(vsync: this);

Gif(
     image: AssetImage("images/animate.gif"),
     controller: _controller, // if duration and fps is null, original gif fps will be used.
     //fps: 30,               
     //duration: const Duration(seconds: 3),
     autostart: Autostart.no,
     placeholder: (context) => const Text('Loading...'),
     onFetchCompleted: () {
          _controller.reset();
          _controller.forward();
     },
),
 ```
